https://jamescoffeeco.com/ -> I like it because it's very minimalistic and clean easy to navigate and the user knows where to go in seconds. One look and you know what this page is all about. 

https://www.ebay.co.uk/ -> A bit controversial and old-school providing many options for the user but not overcomplicated. The fact that they change so little from the design for years proves it work. 

https://www.apple.com/ -> When I'm visiting apples web page it always make me feel I'm browsing in to the future. The design and animations are super smooth and the information can be found easily. Containing just enough of information for the products on first view and the links to discover more are on the right places.
